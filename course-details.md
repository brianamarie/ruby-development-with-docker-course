Learn how to develop Ruby scripts without having to worry about installing language rumtime(s) or tools and their dependencies!
​

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is the latest craze in the computing world. Ok, maybe not. But it's a great tool for building environments custom-tuned for your code to run in because it allows you to wrap up dependencies into container images that can be transported from one machine to another. 

​
This is great, because you know that the FRIGGEN version of nokogiri that you compiled in your docker container on your local machine is the same one that is running in Dev, Stage and Prod. This same set of concerns can be solved for _sharing_ local development environments too! Without having to deal with Ansible and other machine-provisioning tools. If the machine can run docker, it can run your app/code.
